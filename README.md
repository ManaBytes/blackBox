# blackBox

Black box design, reverse engineering AI spaghetti. Maybe we'll find some nuggets. Ohh there's gold in the spaghetti.
<br>/_ Ensure specificity _/

<!-- /* Does this count as explaining the joke? */ -->

Prototype for a tool to understand and interact with unfathomable systems...also known as JS, and tangentially LLMs.
Sprinkle some node in the mix. 📞 Forks, lots of forks. ☎️ Ohh and a flip phone with an antenna. 📵 What do you mean they don't exist? 📲 📱 📳
<br> But I can 📠 people.  
<br>But this one is even more obscure...and dangerous. 📟

Determine deep truths of the universe such as;

- Is Node.js an insatiable cancer that should be avoided like the plague?
- Are LLMs a shining example of how to create a iterative fractal systems that can adapt for the future?
- Should the subjects of the last two sentences be swapped?

Is it even safe to rely on a recursive system?
